# Voice Project
The goal of this project is to experiment with voice assistance.

## Problem
In a time where laws on phone use while driving are becomming more strict, Automakers have been making their infortainment systems more phone like. Changes such as:
- More Screens
- Larger screens
- Increased connectivity
- Feature packed menus

and more have made our vehicles less intuitive to use. They have also increased 

## Solution
I propose that we need to move away from screens and find an alternative way for drivers to interact with their cars. 

I this project I want to investigate voice assistants as a potential solution. 

Voice assistance could replace screens because of the following:
- Allows for a diverse set of commands
- Driver does not have use their hands or eyes for the interaction
    - both of which are be occupied with driving
- Intuitive, just like communicating to the passenger
